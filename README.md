# Graph Animation Project

## Descriptions
This project is inspired by https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html.
My script will create many individual GIF images based on a text file describing nodes, edges, and their attributes, then they will be combined into a single animated GIF.

## How to run 

./anime.py duplications.txt (linear|logarithmic) anim.gif

You need to select either linear or logarithmic to specify how nodes will be  moved. 

## Expected Result
ex)duplications.txt
