# Graph Animation Project

##Descriptions
This project is inspired by https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html.
My script will create many individual GIF images based on a text file describing nodes, edges, and their attributes, then they will be combined into a single animated GIF.
